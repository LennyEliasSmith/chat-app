Greetings,

My name is Lenny Smith and I am a first year Interactive Media student, currently taking the Web and App minor.
I've been interested in game development for some time now, so I spend a lot of time making little demos in Unity / Unreal and occasionally
volunteering with the local IGDA chapter. Other than that I've been trying my best to learn to draw and slowly but surely it is getting easier.
Over the course of my first year, I've become pretty interested in Web Dev too and I am definitley eager to learn atleast one stack, which
admittedly is quite a task.

As for experience in web dev, I've taken a bunch of online courses on Udemy / Linkedin Learning, but alot of them have been on the basics like
html, css, javascript. So most of my experience has come through TAMK's courses. I'd definitley love to learn more! 

When I grow up, I want to have a job that challenges me and excites me. Not really sure what that job will be yet, but so far development -esque
careers seem to be the best bet. So yes, when I grow up I want to be a senior developer somewhere nice. Preferably doing something a little more
design focused, like UI/UX for example.

Other than that, I look forward to this course.

Cheers, Lenny Smith.
